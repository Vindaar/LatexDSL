* v0.2.1
- support Nim doc comments and turn them into LaTeX comments
- support complex expressions in a quote, i.e. `x.foo.bar`.
  *Note*: *Only* dot expressions are supported. Call or command syntax
  are not allowed!
- *Potentially breaking* (unlikely): If you used the ~compile~ helper
  with ~fullBody = true~, previously it injected a ~\begin/end
  document~ around the given body. That is not really very useful, if
  one wants to pass a full TeX file to compile including header and
  everything. 
* v0.2.0
- ~DEBUG_TEX~ can be set as an environment variable to overwrite the
  verbosity setting of the LaTeX compiler
- the priority of the LaTeX compilers was changed to prefer LuaLaTeX
  over XeLaTeX due to its saner font handling
- adds three configuration files, for the preamble and XeLaTeX and
  LuaLaTeX font settings (see README)
- other minor fixes
* v0.1.14
- fixes the ~verbose~ argument to ~compile~ such that it actually
  takes effect
* v0.1.13
- allow to hand custom output path to ~compile~
- allow to disable ~shell~ output when compiling via ~verbose~ option
- add ~TeXDaemon~ submodule (~latexdsl/tex_daemon.nim~) which allows
  to spawn a TeX process, which runs in the background for you to
  process TeX commands at will. The idea is to have a TeX compiler
  ready on demand (without startup latency) to e.g. compute the width
  / height / depth of a piece of text (in particular for ggplotnim's
  TikZ backend)
* v0.1.12
- allow handing a custom template to ~compile~
* v0.1.11
- make sure =math= can be used inside of a template, by adding a
  =unsym= stage before actually entering the DSL logic. We use a check
  for nim symbols in the logic to avoid infinite recursions, so
  receiving a symbol from the input causes things to break
- =MathDelim= can be set more easily in a =static= context now
- remove dependency on datamancer (only for tests)
- add dependency for =shell= (for latex compilation)
- add more tests        
* v0.1.10
- make sure =compile= can be used in a =static= context
  (Note to self: =shell= only works in NimScript, but not in =nimvm=...)
* v0.1.9
- add =mathrm= as valid TeX command
- handle int and float literals correctly
- when using =_= after a TeX command only check the part before as a
  valid / invalid TeX command    
* v0.1.8
- add missing =frac= as valid TeX command
- add =latexdsl_nochecks= module that can be imported to deactivate CT
  checks. This is useful if you have static code that uses latexdsl
  and wants to avoid the expensive CT penalty of generating the enum
  for the allowed commands on each compilation.
- add =latex_compiler= submodule that allows to directly compile a
  latex snippet as a standalone and produce a PDF from it
- add =math= scope that can be used to auto wrap a body in a math
  environment. The delimiter is =$= by default but can be changed at
  CT (using a =static= block) using the =MathDelim= variable.
* v0.1.7
- add support for Nim v1.4 again, only =toTexTable= is exempt, which
  allows dependencies to support 1.4
* v0.1.6
- refactor code to split helpers and DSL
- drop support for Nim 1.4, as the concepts for the helpers break the
  compiler, due to the TeX command enum having characters that are
  binary operators (fixed in 1.6, so I'm not going to work around that
  for old Nim, sorry)
* v0.1.5
- set up docs
- set up CI via Github Actions
- replace internal =&= =NimNode= concatenation by =&&=
- do not export =strformat= any longer    
* v0.1.4
- improve handling of =nnkCommand= to automatically insert
  spaces. This is for the typical case of writing multiple identifiers
  after another to not have to add manual spaces.
- handle =nnkBracket= and =nnkAsgn= (as well as =nnkIdent= to an
  extent)
- allow quoting of Nim expressions using =$(...)= syntax. Any Nim
  expression that can be string evaluated using =$= is allowed in the construct.
* v0.1.3
- allow pragma syntax ={. ... .}= for multiline ={}= arguments
- properly handle successive tex commands using =\= (nnkInfix)
- add some caveats to README
- add some tabularx commands to CT checked list
- add =tableRows= helper proc to join a =varargs[string]= into a valid
  TeX table row
* v0.1.2
- improve example in README to make use of =latex= macro for the
  captions. Why have it and not use it?
- allow =nnkRefTy= (for =\ref=), =nnkCurly= and check commands only if
  not a nested =nnkAccQuoted=
* v0.1.1
- add sugar:
  - =figure=: create TeX code for a figure, including the option to
    check whether the file exists at runtime
  - =toTexTable=: converts something like a ggplotnim =DataFrame= to a
    TeX table
- fix an issue with accidentally looking at already parsed TeX code again
* v0.1.0
- basic =latex= macro with compile time checks of most important TeX
  commands is working, allowing for Nim symbol interpolation
