* v0.1.2
- improve example in README to make use of =latex= macro for the
  captions. Why have it and not use it?
- allow =nnkRefTy= (for =\ref=), =nnkCurly= and check commands only if
  not a nested =nnkAccQuoted=
* v0.1.1
- add sugar:
  - =figure=: create TeX code for a figure, including the option to
    check whether the file exists at runtime
  - =toTexTable=: converts something like a ggplotnim =DataFrame= to a
    TeX table
- fix an issue with accidentally looking at already parsed TeX code again
* v0.1.0
- basic =latex= macro with compile time checks of most important TeX
  commands is working, allowing for Nim symbol interpolation
